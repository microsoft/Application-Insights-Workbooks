## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the templates shown in the workbook galleries of [Azure Monitor Workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-usage-workbooks). Templates added to this repository will show up in the various Workbook Galleries for users of Azure Monitor Workbooks. By contributing templates, you can help others solve interesting problems using the workbooks you've found helpful on your own team.

## Azure Monitor Workbooks

Workbooks allow Azure Monitor users to create customizable interactive reports and analytic narratives by providing a flexible canvas that allows them to:

1.	Create rich visual reports and analytics experiences within the Azure portal.
2.	Use metric, log and Azure Resource Graph data
3.	Build interactive experiences based on user input
4.	Customize their analysis and persist for later use.
5.	Use templates for curated analysis from a public gallery
6.	Leverage ARM programmability to create and manage their workbook assets.

These capabilities of workbooks can be used to create curated and customized reports, analytic narratives, dashboards, etc.
