# Tile Visualization

Tiles are a very useful way to present summary data in workbooks. The image below shows a common use case of tiles - app level summary on top of a detailed grid.

Workbook tiles support showing a title, subtitle, large text, icons, metric based gradients, spark line/bars, footer, etc. 

## Adding a Tile
1. Switch the workbook to edit mode by clicking on the _Edit_ toolbar item.
2. Use the _Add query_ link to add a log query control to the workbook. 
3. Select the query type as _Log_, resource type (e.g. Application Insights) and the resources to target.
4. Use the Query editor to enter the KQL for your analysis
    ```
    requests
    | summarize Requests = count() by appName, name
    | top 7 by Requests desc
    ```
5. Set Size to _Full_
6. Set the visualization to _Tiles_
7. Click the _Tile Settings_ button to open the settings pane
8. In _Tile Fields_, set:
    1. Title: `name`
    2. Left: `Requests`, Renderer: `Big Number`, Color Palette: `Green to Red`, Min Value: `0`
    3. Bottom: `appName`
8. Click the _Save and Close_ button at the bottom of the pane.

This is how the tiles will look like in read mode:

## Spark lines in Tiles
1. Create a query control using steps 1-3 above.
2. Add a time range parameter called _TimeRange_ above the query control.
3. Use the Query editor to enter the KQL for your analysis
    ```
    let topRequests = requests
    | summarize Requests = count() by appName, name
    | top 7 by Requests desc;
    let topRequestNames = topRequests | project name;
    requests
    | where name in (topRequestNames)
    | make-series Trend = count() default = 0 on timestamp from {TimeRange:start} to {TimeRange:end} step {TimeRange:grain} by name
    | join (topRequests) on name
    | project-away name1, timestamp
    ```
4. Set Size to _Full_
5. Set the visualization to _Tiles_
6. Click the _Tile Settings_ button to open the settings pane
7. In _Tile Fields_, set:
    1. Title: `name`
    2. Subtitle: `appName`
    3. Left: `Requests`, Renderer: `Big Number`, Color Palette: `Green to Red`, Min Value: `0`
    4. Bottom: `Trend`, Renderer: `Spark line`, Color palette: `Green to Red`, Minimul Value: `0`
8. Click the _Save and Close_ button at the bottom of the pane.

## Tile sizes
The author has an option to set the tile width in the tile settings 
* `fixed` (default) - The default behavior of tiles is to be the same fixed width, ~160 pixels wide, plus space around the tiles
  ![image displaying fixed width tiles](../Images/Tiles-fixed.png)
* `auto` - Each tile will shrink or grow to fit their contents, but being limited to the width of the tiles view (no horizontal scrolling)
  ![image displaying fixed width tiles](../Images/Tiles-auto.png)
* `full size` - Each tile will always be the full width of the tiles view, one tile per line.

*Tiles also support Composite bar renderer. Refer [Composite Bar](./CompositeBar.md) for details*
