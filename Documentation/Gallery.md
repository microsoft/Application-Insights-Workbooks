Here is the new gallery for the workbooks.

The gallery has 4 tabs:.
* All: It shows all the items for each type â€“ Workbooks, Public Templates, and My Templates. Workbooks are sorted by modified date. Public Templates and My Templates are sorted based on order property. All tab has the card view as default view. There is a switch layout button to switch between card and list view.

### What's cool in new gallery
1. The gallery has clear segment division -> There are different sections for Workbooks, Public Templates, and My Templates.
2. The gallery shows a lot more metadata compared to what we had in old gallery. ex. tags, description, resource groups, region, etc.
3. The user can see all items in gallery without clicking on the 'Open' button that we had in old gallery
4. The columns in grids are sortable. So user can sort the rows say by last modified time, name, category etc.
5. User can filter based on multiple subscriptions and resource groups. The user can view Workbooks under multiple subscriptions and resource groups on single page.

6. Earlier user could only filter by name or subscriptions. In new gallery, user can filter by Workbook/template name or template category, subscriptions and resource groups.
