# Deprecated Troubleshooting Guides Retrieval

Troubleshooting guides are deprecated. The "Troubleshooting Guides" menu item is going away, but You'll continue to have access to them via the Workbooks browse blade. If you want to move your workbooks from the Troubleshooting Guide gallery to the Workbook gallery, we've added a function to allow users to change workbook types to any of the possible types.

# Change Workbook Type Methods
    
## Inside the workbook
1. open up a workbook and enter edit mode (if not already in edit mode) by clicking the 'Edit' button in the toolbar. Then click the 'More editing options' button to find the new 'Change Type' button.
