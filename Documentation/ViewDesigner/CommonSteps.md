## Quick Start with preset View Designer Templates <a id="QuickStart"></a>

Workbooks in LA workspaces already have templates made to match some of the views in View Designer. Under the View Designer Guides category, select the "View Designer Transition Guide" to learn about your options or select one of the many preset templates.

[Click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces) to view your Log Analytics workspaces and get started with Workbooks.

## Enabling Time Range Filter <a id="Filter"></a>
View Designer has a built-in default Time Range filter, however, in Workbooks this setting is not enabled by default. Workbooks does allow users to create their own Time Range filters that might be more applicable to their data logs. The steps to generate the filter are listed below:

Select the **Add parameters** option

![Add Param](./Examples/AddParam.png)

The default Style is set to **Pills**

Select the **Add Parameter** button

![Add Parameter](./Examples/AddParameter.png)

From the sidebar menu, in the **Parameter name** textbox, type “TimeRange”

Set **Parameter Type** as “Time Range Picker”

Select the “Required?” checkbox

![Parameter Menu](./Examples/ParamMenu.png)

Save the parameter in the upper left hand corner of the sidebar menu

You can leave the dropdown as “unset” by default or select a default TimeRange value, such as 24 hours.

Select **Done Editing**

Parameters can be utilized in queries by adding curly braces {} around your parameter name.

More details on parameters can be found in the [Workbooks Documentation on Parameters](https://github.com/microsoft/Application-Insights-Workbooks/blob/master/Documentation/Parameters/Parameters.md).

## Updating Queries with the TimeRange Parameter <a id="Update"></a>
**Option 1: Select TimeRange from the Time Range Dropdown for each query**
![Time Parameter](./Examples/TimeParam.png)

**Option 2: Update your KQL queries**

Within your query add this line: _| where TimeGenerated {TimeRange}_

**Example:**

**Original:** _search * | summarize count() by Type_

**Updated:** _search * **| where TimeGenerated {TimeRange}** | summarize count() by Type_

## Including a List <a id="List"></a>
Most of the View Designer views include a list, this standard list can be re-produced utilizing the following steps.

![Tile List](./Examples/TileList.png)

You will need to add a visualization by clicking **Add query** from the cell options

![Add Param](./Examples/AddParam.png)

View Designer employs a default query that matches the syntax from the Original example. This can be updated by changing the query to the updated form.

**Original:** _search * | summarize **AggregatedValue** = count() by Type_\
**Updated:** _search * | summarize **Count** = count() by Type_

This will generate a list that looks similar to the following:

![List Example](./Examples/ListEx.png)

## Enabling Sparklines <a id="Sparkline"></a>
A common feature for grids is to add sparklines to summarize various data patterns over time. View Designer offers the Enable Sparklines feature for all lists, as does Workbooks.

To include Sparklines in your data that match View Designer, you will need to join the data with your original query. You will need to add the following line

_| join kind = inner (search * \
| make-series Trend = count() default=0 on TimeGenerated from \{TimeRange:start} to {TimeRange:end} step {TimeRange:grain} by Type)\
on Type_

Then under **Column Settings**
![Column Settings](./Examples/ColumnSettings.png)

Update the **Column renderer** dropdown to be a Spark area
![Sparklines](./Examples/Sparkline.png)

Then save the settings and re-running the query will now update your table to include a Sparkline

Example:\
**Original:**\
_search *\
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Type) on Type_\
**Updated:**\
_search *\
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Type\
**| join kind = inner (search * \
| make-series Trend = count() default=0 on TimeGenerated from \{TimeRange:start} to {TimeRange:end} step {TimeRange:grain} by Type\
) on Type\
| project Type, AggregatedValue, Trend**_

Resulting grid will look similar to below:
![Sparkline Example](./Examples/SparkEx.png)

## Advanced Cell Settings <a id="Advanced"></a>
To mirror View Designer, some common steps such as changing the size of Workbook cells or adding pins and external links to logs might be utilized.

To access Advanced Settings, use the advanced settings tab in edit mode, which will contain additional settings.

![Advanced Settings Settings](./Examples/AdvSetSettings.png)

To add a pin and a link to an external query simply select the corresponding checkboxes.

To add a title to your cell, simply type the desired title into the **Chart title** section.

When the query succeeded but returned no results, the default message displayed is "The query returned no results". To show a custom message, edit **No data message** field. The default style for this message is "Info". Select a style from dropdown **No data message style** to set custom style to the message.

By default any Workbooks cell is set to take up the entire page width, but users can adjust this by scaling the cell down, by clicking under the **Style** tab in edit mode.

![Advanced Settings Style](./Examples/AdvSetStyle.png)

 
## Additional Parameters <a id="Additional"></a>

Similar to the TimeRange Filter, you select **Add Parameter**
For selecting a Subscription, type “Subscription” into the **Parameter name** field in the side menu and select “Subscription Picker” from the **Parameter type** dropdown

![Subscription Menu](./Examples/SubFilter.png)

For selecting a Resource, type “Resource” into the **Parameter name** field 
in the side menu and select “Resource Picker” from the **Parameter type** dropdown

![Resource Menu](./Examples/ResFilter.png)

This will insert dropdowns to let you access your various subscriptions and resources
