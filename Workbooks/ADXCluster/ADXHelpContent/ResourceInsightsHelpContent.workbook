This rule is important over a long period). <br>This tile shows up to 4 significant digits.\r\n<br>\r\n##### CPU\r\nPercentage of allocated compute resources currently in use by machines in the cluster.<br>\r\nAn average CPU of 80% or less is sustainable for a cluster. The maximum value of CPU is 100%, which means there are no additional compute resources to process data.<br>\r\nWhen a cluster isn't performing well, check the usage tab to to determine if there are specific users or applications that are consuming high CPU. \r\n<br>\r\n##### Ingestion utilization\r\n\r\nPercentage of actual resources used to ingest data from the total resources allocated, in the capacity policy, to perform ingestion.<br>The default capacity policy is no more than 512 concurrent ingestion operations or 75% of the cluster resources invested in ingestion.<br>\r\nAverage ingestion utilization of 80% or less is a sustainable state for a cluster. Maximum value of ingestion utilization is 100%, which means all cluster ingestion ability is used and an ingestion queue may result.\r\n<br>\r\n##### Ingestion latency\r\n\r\nLatency of data ingested, from the time the data was received in the cluster until it's ready for query. <br>The ingestion latency period depends on the ingestion scenario. <br>As a general rule, an average Ingestion Latency above 15 minutes (over a long period) may indicate a problem\r\n<br>\r\n##### Cache utilization factor\r\n\r\n Percentage difference between the current number of instances and the optimal number of instances (per cache utilization).<br> Examples: 100% means that the disk space assigned to hot data is optimally utilized.<br> 90% means that the disk space allocated for hot data is not fully utilized. In this case, 10% more hot data can be added to fit the current scale. Alternatively, the cluster can be scaled-in by 10% and its disk space will still contain the hot data.<br> 110% means that the cluster's disk space is not large enough to accommodate the hot data, as defined by caching policies. To ensure that sufficient space is available for all hot data, the amount of hot data needs to be reduced by 10% or the cluster needs to be scaled out by 10%. <br>It's recommended to use [optimized autoscale](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling#optimized-autoscale) configuration. <br> Cache utilization factor is calculated as: (Optimal number of instances based on data capacity * 100 / Actual number of instances), where 'Optimal number of instances' can be any real number. \r\n<br>\r\n##### Succeeded Ingestions\r\n\r\nTotal number of ingestion operations that succeeded.\r\n<br>\r\n##### Failed ingestions\r\n\r\nTotal number of ingestion operations that failed.<br>\r\nIf this tile is not visible, it means that no failed ingestions detected. <br>\r\nFor more information, you can check the ingestion metrics at the \"Key Metrics\" tab or use the [.show ingestion failures command](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/ingestionfailures).<br>\r\nIngestion failures that occur during other parts of the ingestion flow will not appear in the result set of this command. Such a failure may occur, for example, before data ingestion control commands are sent to the Azure Data Explorer Data Engine service."
